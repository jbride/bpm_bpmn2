== Overview

=== *ConcurrentPInstanceSignal* example

image::images/concurrentPInstanceSignal.png[]

Often times, it is possible that multiple signals could be invoked on a process instance that is in a wait state at the same time.
A business application should not have to concern itself with ensuring that external signals to a process instance in a wait state are synchronized.
Instead, the process engine should be able to handle concurrent signals to the same process instance in a graceful manner.
The purpose of the *ConcurrentPInstanceSignal* process is to demonstrate the behavior of the BPM Suite 6 process engine when concurrent signals are invoked on the same process instance in a wait-state.

Details and instructions to execute this example can be found link:concurrent_pinstance_signal.adoc[here].

=== *Signal SubProcess Wait-State* 

This example includes the following parent process and re-usable sub-process:

.signalSubprocess
image::images/signalSubprocess.png[]


.waitForSignal sub-process
image::images/waitForSignal.png[]


The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the behavior of the process engine in processing of the two process instances when a signal is sent to the _catching signal event_ of a re-usable sub-process.
Of note is the different behavior that occurs depending on if the KIE session strategy of the process engine is either _SINGLETON_ or _PER_PROCESS_INSTANCE_.

Instructions to execute this example can be found link:signal_subprocess_waitstate.adoc[here].
