== JBoss GPE Reference Architecture:  BPM Signaling

:numbered:

== Overview

This example includes the following parent process and re-usable sub-process:

.signalSubprocess
image::images/signalSubprocess.png[]


.waitForSignal sub-process
image::images/waitForSignal.png[]


The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the behavior of the process engine in processing of the two process instances when a signal is sent to the _catching signal event_ of the re-usable sub-process.

== Pre-Requisites

. ssh client
. maven 3.0.5 (or greater)
. git client
. curl
. familiarity with {bpmproduct}
. proficiency with basic *nix command line
. docker
. either the mysql or postgresql variant of the {dockerbpms} image

== Set-up
For the purposes of this documentation, the name _$REF_ARCH_HOME_ refers to the root directory of this reference architecture.

=== Start BPM Suite 6
As per the {dockerbpms} documentation, pull and start either the mysql or postgresql variants.

For the purposes of this documentation, the name *docker_bpms* will refer to the ip address of your bpm enabled docker container.
It is recommended that an entry in /etc/hosts be added that maps *docker_bpms* to the actual ip address of your docker container:

-----
172.17.0.2      docker_bpms
-----

NOTE:  the ip address of your docker container is most likely different than the example above.
Check the {dockerbpms} user guide regarding how to determine the ip address.

=== Log into BPM Suite 6

. As per the {dockerbpms} user guide, ssh into the bpm enabled docker container and tail the server.log.
. As per the {dockerbpms} user guide, login to the BPM Console.

=== clone *bpm_signalling* repo
This reference architecture includes a _KIE project_ called _processTier_ that includes various BPM signaling use cases.
This section of the documentation provides guidance on cloning of this reference architecture in BPM Suite 6.

. Create an organization unit
.. In the BPM Console, navigate to:  Authoring -> Administration -> Organizational Units -> Manage Organizational Units
.. Click the _Add_ button and enter in your organizational unit name
+
Any name will do.  We in Red Hat's Global Partner Enablement team typically use an organization name of:  _gpe_.
. clone this git repository as follows:
.. In the BPM Console, naviate to:  Authoring -> Administration -> Repositories -> Clone Repositories
.. Enter in values as per below:
+
image::images/clone.png[]
+
In particular, repository values should be as follows:

... *Repository Name* :   bpmsignalling
... *Organizational Unit* :   replace with your organization name
... *Git URL* :  https://github.com/jboss-gpe-ref-archs/bpm_signalling


=== Deploy *processTier* KIE project
The _bpmsignalling_ repository includes a single _KIE project_ called:  _processTier_.
This KIE project includes a variety of BPMN2 process definitions and custom workItemHandlers that show-case the signaling capabilities of BPM Suite 6.
Deployment of the _processTier_ project is needed to make its contents available for use by the BPM Suite 6 process engine.
For the purposes of this _signal_subprocess_waitstate_ example, the default _Singleton_ KIE session strategy is sufficient.

. In the BPM Console,navigate to:  Authoring -> Tools -> Process Explorer
. Click the _Build and Deploy_ button.

== *Signal Subprocess Waitstate* :  Execution

=== start *Signal Subprocess Waitstate* instance

=== Determine the sub-process instanceId

Is our recommendation to determine the sub-process instanceId by exposing an API that queries the database ?
-----
jbpm=# select processinstanceid from processinstancelog where processid='processTier.subprocess' and parentprocessinstanceid=11;
 processinstanceid 
-------------------
                12
-----

=== Signal the sub-process


== To-Do
